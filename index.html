                <li> After pursuing an English degree and getting nowhere, I decided to pursue a career in software engineering and development.</li>

          <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>After graduating college, I was stuck in several dead-end jobs. Deciding that I needed a change, I looked to the future and realized web development and software engineering is what I wanted to do.
            </p>
            <p>Now a student at Thinkful, I'm excited to see what the future holds and how much I can learn!
