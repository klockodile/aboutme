          <h2>About Me</h2>
	    <P> Hello! I'm a Korean-American dog mom. I love Googling training videos, dancing salsa, and eating great food!</P>
            <p>After graduating college, I was stuck in several dead-end jobs. Deciding that I needed a change, I looked to the future and realized web development and software engineering is what I wanted to do
            </p>	     
            <p>Now a student at Thinkful, I'm excited to see what the future holds and how much I can learn! Hope we can collaborate and work together in the future because I love teamwork!
